# Servicer Bonus Calculations

This script is to determine the interest savings for Sprint for paying MLS the acceleration of rental payments and device values before the expiration of the customer's lease term. There are two calculations that need to be done. First, the device servicer bonus, which is the interest savings of receiving the value of the device before the lease term expiration. The second is the receivables servicer bonus, which is the interest savings of receiving a sum of rental streams before the lease term expiration.

This script aims to take in all of the devices that the company has accelerated, run the calculations of the device servicer bonus and receivables servicer bonus, and create a CSV file with the necessary fields to create a report in Excel to send to Sprint.
